##Caffe on Laptop Ubuntu

* `Python.h` location: `/usr/include/python2.7`
* `numpy/arrayobject.h` location: `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/include`
* MATLAB location: `/usr/local/MATLAB/R2014b`
* Compile Python/MATLAB interface: `make pycaffe`, `make matcaffe`
* Protobuf definition location: `src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto`
* In examples/detection.ipynb, the model should be downloaded with `./scripts/download_model_binary.py model/bvlc_reference_rcnn_ilsvrc13`

##Caffe on Arco

* `Python.h` location: `/usr/include/python2.7`
* `numpy/arrayobject.h` location: `/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/core/include`
* BLAS location: `BLAS_INCLUDE := /usr/include/atlas` `BLAS_LIB := /usr/lib/atlas-base`
* Caffe requires CUDA directory to contain `include/` in addition to `bin/` and `lib/`. However, in default CUDA directory, `lib/` is called `lib64/`. Walk-around: create directory `/data2/libo/cuda`, and create symbolic links: `bin -> /usr/local/cuda/bin`, `include -> /usr/local/cuda/include`, and `lib -> /usr/local/cuda/lib64`
* Add `libprotoc.so.x` to path: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib`
* Under caffe root directory, manually generate `include/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.h`:
	1. `protoc src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto --cpp_out=.`
	2. `mkdir include/caffe/proto`
	3. `mv src/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.h include/caffe/proto`
* Compile with `cmake` to have consistent version of `libprotobuf`
* Monitor GPU usage with `nvidia-smi`. Allow window duplication with `tmux`
* To allow caffe in Python, add `libcudart.so.6.5` and `libcblas.so.3gf` to path: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-6.5/targets/x86_64-linux/lib:/usr/lib/atlas-base`, then start python from `/data2/libo/caffe/python`
* Package `h5py` needs to be installed manually

##Multiclass Fine-Tune

* Caffe only accepts multiclass input from HDF5 layer. Ref: http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/high/dataset.html
* Color images decoded with OpenCV has axis sequence XY[BGR], whereas `caffe.io.load_image` decodes to axis sequence XY[RGB]
* `ilsvrc_2012_mean.npy` has axis sequence [BGR]XY, where X, Y $\in$ [256,256]. Data type is `np.float64`. Range is [0, 255]
* Caffe models trained on ImageNet has channel sequence BGR
* Changes required in the input layer of a Caffe network:
	1. Data layer type is `"HDF5Data"`. All transformations are removed. `data_param` is changed to `hdf5_data_param`
	2. A Softmax layer is inserted between `fc8_pascal` and the loss layer, i.e. Inner product -> Softmax -> Sigmoid Cross Entropy Loss
	3. Loss layer type is `"SigmoidCrossEntropyLoss"`
	4. TEST phase is removed due to the lack of metric to hierarchical classification accuracy
* Caffe does not support data transformation for HDF5 input. Mean subtraction needs to be done outside. Also, each input image should have axis sequence [BGR]XY, where X, Y $\in$ [227,227]

## Other Notes
what's done:
	* Defined four types of binary hierarchical classification accuracy
	* Trained caffe with binary hierarchical classification data
	* Trained multiclass binary classification on 4096 feature responses
what's not done:
	* develop new hierarchical concept set with visual clue
