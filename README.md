Image Understanding with Concept Graph

This is an ongoing honours project at the Australian National University.

In this project, we aim to improve the accuracy of image classification by combining a convolutional neural network with a graphical model describing the relationship between concepts and objects in a scene.

This project is based on Deng et al's ECCV 2014 paper: Large-Scale Object Classification using Label Relationship Graph. The dataset is currently PASCAL, but shall extend to ImageNet soon.
