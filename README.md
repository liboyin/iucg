# Improving Image Understanding with Concept Relation Graph

This is a finished honours project at the Australian National University.

This project is based on Deng et al's ECCV 2014 paper: Large-Scale Object Classification using Label Relationship Graph.

I identified the weakness of the original work under imbalanced and coarsely-labelled training dataset, and improved the framework by considering additional between-concept information. I also experimentally allowed learning on all components of the system.

The improved system achieved 15% improvement over the original work in classification accuracy.
